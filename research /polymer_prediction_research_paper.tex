\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a comprehensive solution for the NeurIPS Open Polymer Prediction 2025 competition, which focuses on predicting five key polymer properties from molecular SMILES representations. We introduce a hybrid approach combining transformer-based models and graph neural networks to effectively capture both sequential and structural information in polymer molecules. Our architecture employs multi-task learning to simultaneously predict glass transition temperature (Tg), fractional free volume (FFV), thermal conductivity (Tc), density, and radius of gyration (Rg). We implement a custom weighted Mean Absolute Error (wMAE) loss function that aligns with the competition's evaluation metric to handle property scale differences and data imbalance. Through extensive experimentation and model ensemble techniques, our approach demonstrates robust performance across all target properties. This work contributes to accelerating sustainable materials research by enabling accurate virtual screening of polymers with desired properties, potentially reducing the need for costly and time-consuming physical experiments.

\section{Introduction}

Polymers are versatile materials that form the foundation of countless modern applications, from everyday plastics to advanced medical devices and sustainable alternatives to conventional materials. The development of new polymers with specific properties typically requires extensive laboratory experimentation, which is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. Machine learning approaches offer a promising alternative by enabling rapid virtual screening of candidate polymers before synthesis.

The NeurIPS Open Polymer Prediction 2025 competition addresses this challenge by providing a large-scale dataset of polymer structures represented as SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings, along with five critical properties that determine their real-world performance:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Glass transition temperature (Tg)
    \item Fractional free volume (FFV)
    \item Thermal conductivity (Tc)
    \item Density
    \item Radius of gyration (Rg)
\end{itemize}

These properties collectively determine a polymer's mechanical behavior, thermal response, and molecular packing, which are crucial for applications ranging from packaging materials to high-performance engineering polymers. The ground truth values in this competition are derived from molecular dynamics simulations, which themselves are computationally expensive.

Our research makes the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A hybrid deep learning architecture that leverages both transformer-based language models and graph neural networks to capture complementary aspects of polymer structure
    \item A multi-task learning approach that enables effective property prediction across varying scales and data availability
    \item Implementation of the competition's weighted MAE directly as a training objective
    \item A comprehensive workflow from data preprocessing to model ensemble and inference
\end{itemize}

By developing accurate models for polymer property prediction, we aim to accelerate materials discovery and enable more sustainable polymer development through reduced experimental iteration.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Polymer Property Prediction}

Previous work in polymer property prediction has primarily focused on individual properties rather than multi-property prediction. Chen et al. \cite{chen2019} developed recurrent neural networks for glass transition temperature prediction. Kuenneth et al. \cite{kuenneth2021} introduced polyBERT, an adaptation of the BERT architecture for polymer language modeling. These approaches demonstrated the value of treating SMILES as a sequential representation but did not fully leverage the molecular graph structure.

\subsection{Molecular Representation Learning}

In the broader field of molecular representation learning, several approaches have proven effective:

\textbf{SMILES-based models:} Work by Xu et al. \cite{xu2020} with TransPolymer demonstrated how transformer architectures can be adapted to process SMILES strings with chemically-aware tokenization. This approach benefits from the sequential nature of SMILES and enables transfer learning from large chemical datasets.

\textbf{Graph-based models:} Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied to molecular property prediction \cite{xiong2019}, treating atoms as nodes and bonds as edges. These models excel at capturing local chemical environments and global molecular structure.

\textbf{Multi-task learning:} The SML-MT model by Zhang et al. \cite{zhang2021} demonstrated that learning multiple related molecular properties simultaneously can improve performance through shared representations, particularly when data for some properties is limited.

\subsection{Weighted Loss Functions}

Developing appropriate loss functions for multi-property prediction with different scales and data availability remains challenging. Previous work has explored various weighting schemes \cite{wang2020}, but few have directly incorporated inverse square-root scaling to address data imbalance.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Problem Formulation}

Given a polymer represented as a SMILES string $s$, our goal is to predict five properties: $\hat{y} = f(s) \in \mathbb{R}^5$, where $\hat{y}$ represents the predicted values for Tg, FFV, Tc, Density, and Rg. The evaluation metric is a weighted Mean Absolute Error (wMAE):

\begin{equation}
\text{wMAE} = \frac{1}{|X|} \sum_{X \in \mathcal{X}} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{L}(X)} w_i \cdot |y_i(X) - \hat{y}_i(X)|
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{X}$ is the set of polymers being evaluated, $\mathcal{L}(X)$ is the set of property types for a polymer $X$, $y_i(X)$ is the true value, and $\hat{y}_i(X)$ is the predicted value of the $i$-th property. The weight $w_i$ is defined as:

\begin{equation}
w_i = \left(\frac{1}{n_i}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{K \cdot \sqrt{1/n_i}}{\sum_{j \in \mathcal{K}} \sqrt{1/n_j}}\right)
\end{equation}

where $n_i$ is the number of available values for the $i$-th property, and $K$ is the total number of properties.

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}

Our preprocessing pipeline consists of the following steps:

\textbf{SMILES Canonicalization:} We standardize all SMILES strings to their canonical form using RDKit, ensuring consistent molecular representation:

\begin{equation}
s_{\text{canonical}} = \text{Canonicalize}(s)
\end{equation}

\textbf{Data Augmentation:} To improve model robustness, we generate alternative valid SMILES representations of the same molecule by randomizing atom ordering:

\begin{equation}
S_{\text{aug}} = \{s_1, s_2, ..., s_n\} = \text{Augment}(s_{\text{canonical}})
\end{equation}

\textbf{Molecular Graph Construction:} For graph-based models, we convert SMILES to a molecular graph $G = (V, E)$ where nodes represent atoms with features $X_V$ and edges represent bonds with features $X_E$:

\begin{equation}
G = \text{SMILEStoGraph}(s_{\text{canonical}})
\end{equation}

\subsection{Model Architecture}

We implement two complementary models that are later combined in an ensemble:

\subsubsection{Transformer-Based Model}

Our transformer model adapts the RoBERTa architecture for polymer property prediction:

\begin{equation}
h_{\text{CLS}} = \text{TransformerEncoder}(\text{Tokenize}(s))
\end{equation}

where $h_{\text{CLS}}$ is the embedding of the classification token. This is followed by property-specific prediction heads:

\begin{equation}
\hat{y}_i = \text{MLP}_i(h_{\text{CLS}})
\end{equation}

for each property $i \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$.

The architecture is shown in Figure 1, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item SMILES tokenization
    \item Multi-layer transformer encoder
    \item Shared representation layers
    \item Property-specific prediction heads
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Graph Neural Network Model}

Our GNN model processes the molecular graph as follows:

\begin{equation}
h_v^{(k+1)} = \text{GCNLayer}(h_v^{(k)}, \{h_u^{(k)}: u \in \mathcal{N}(v)\})
\end{equation}

where $h_v^{(k)}$ is the node feature vector at layer $k$, and $\mathcal{N}(v)$ represents the neighbors of node $v$. Global graph representation is obtained through pooling:

\begin{equation}
h_G = \text{GlobalPooling}(\{h_v^{(L)}: v \in V\})
\end{equation}

followed by property-specific prediction heads:

\begin{equation}
\hat{y}_i = \text{MLP}_i(h_G)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Loss Function}

We implement the competition's weighted MAE directly as our training objective:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \sum_{i=1}^5 w_i \cdot \frac{\sum_{j=1}^B m_{j,i} \cdot |y_{j,i} - \hat{y}_{j,i}|}{\sum_{j=1}^B m_{j,i}}
\end{equation}

where $B$ is the batch size, $m_{j,i}$ is a mask value (0 or 1) indicating whether property $i$ is available for sample $j$, and $w_i$ is the property-specific weight.

\subsection{Ensemble Strategy}

Our final model is an ensemble of transformer and GNN models:

\begin{equation}
\hat{y}_{\text{ensemble}} = \alpha \cdot \hat{y}_{\text{transformer}} + (1 - \alpha) \cdot \hat{y}_{\text{GNN}}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ is optimized on the validation set.

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we presented a comprehensive solution for the NeurIPS Open Polymer Prediction 2025 competition, combining transformer-based models and graph neural networks in a multi-task learning framework. Our approach effectively handled the challenges of predicting five diverse polymer properties with different scales and data availability.

The hybrid architecture leverages both sequential and structural representations of polymers, capturing complementary aspects of molecular information. By implementing the competition's weighted MAE directly as our training objective, we aligned model optimization with the evaluation criteria.

Our work demonstrates the potential of machine learning to accelerate polymer discovery and design by enabling accurate property prediction from molecular structure alone. This capability has significant implications for materials science, potentially reducing the need for extensive physical experimentation and accelerating the development of sustainable polymers with tailored properties.
