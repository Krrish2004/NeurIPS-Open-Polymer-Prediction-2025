\begin{abstract}
This paper presents a comprehensive solution for the \method{NeurIPS Open Polymer Prediction 2025} competition, focusing on predicting five key polymer properties from molecular SMILES representations. We introduce a hybrid approach combining \model{transformer-based models} and \model{graph neural networks} to effectively capture both sequential and structural information in polymer molecules. Our architecture employs \method{multi-task learning} to simultaneously predict glass transition temperature (T$_g$), fractional free volume (FFV), thermal conductivity (T$_c$), density, and radius of gyration (R$_g$). We implement a custom \method{weighted Mean Absolute Error (wMAE)} loss function that aligns with the competition's evaluation metric to handle property scale differences and data imbalance. Through extensive experimentation and model ensemble techniques, our approach demonstrates robust performance across all target properties, achieving a \textbf{weighted MAE of 8.418} with our \model{ensemble model} in 5-fold cross-validation. The \model{transformer model} achieved 8.623 and the \model{GNN model} achieved 9.717, significantly outperforming traditional baselines. This work contributes to accelerating sustainable materials research by enabling accurate virtual screening of polymers with desired properties, potentially reducing the need for costly and time-consuming physical experiments.

\section{Introduction}

Polymers are versatile materials that form the foundation of countless modern applications, from everyday plastics to advanced medical devices and sustainable alternatives to conventional materials. The development of new polymers with specific properties typically requires extensive laboratory experimentation, which is both time-consuming and resource-intensive. Machine learning approaches offer a promising alternative by enabling rapid virtual screening of candidate polymers before synthesis.

The \method{NeurIPS Open Polymer Prediction 2025} competition addresses this challenge by providing a large-scale dataset of polymer structures represented as SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings, along with five critical properties that determine their real-world performance:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em, itemsep=0.2em]
    \item \textbf{\color{blue!70!black}Glass transition temperature (T$_g$)}: The temperature at which a polymer transitions from a hard, glassy material to a soft, rubbery state
    \item \textbf{\color{blue!70!black}Fractional free volume (FFV)}: The ratio of free volume to total volume, affecting permeability and diffusion
    \item \textbf{\color{blue!70!black}Thermal conductivity (T$_c$)}: The ability to conduct heat, crucial for thermal management applications
    \item \textbf{\color{blue!70!black}Density}: Mass per unit volume, affecting mechanical properties and processing
    \item \textbf{\color{blue!70!black}Radius of gyration (R$_g$)}: A measure of polymer chain size and conformation
\end{itemize}

These properties collectively determine a polymer's mechanical behavior, thermal response, and molecular packing, which are crucial for applications ranging from packaging materials to high-performance engineering polymers. The ground truth values in this competition are derived from molecular dynamics simulations, which themselves are computationally expensive.

Our research makes the following \textbf{\color{blue!70!black}key contributions}:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em, itemsep=0.3em]
    \item \textbf{Hybrid Architecture}: A novel deep learning architecture that leverages both \model{transformer-based language models} and \model{graph neural networks} to capture complementary aspects of polymer structure
    \item \textbf{Multi-task Learning}: An effective approach that enables property prediction across varying scales and data availability with \textgreater90\% missing values
    \item \textbf{Competition-Aligned Loss}: Direct implementation of the competition's \method{weighted MAE} as a training objective for optimal performance
    \item \textbf{End-to-End Pipeline}: A comprehensive workflow from data preprocessing to model ensemble and inference with \textbf{RDKit-free} implementation
    \item \textbf{Empirical Validation}: Extensive evaluation demonstrating superior performance over traditional baselines on the competition dataset
\end{itemize}

By developing accurate models for polymer property prediction, we aim to accelerate materials discovery and enable more sustainable polymer development through reduced experimental iteration.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Polymer Property Prediction}

Previous work in polymer property prediction has primarily focused on individual properties rather than multi-property prediction. Chen et al. \cite{chen2019} developed recurrent neural networks for glass transition temperature prediction, achieving mean absolute errors of approximately 11Â°C. Kuenneth et al. \cite{kuenneth2021} introduced polyBERT, an adaptation of the BERT architecture for polymer language modeling, which demonstrated improved performance over traditional descriptor-based methods. These approaches demonstrated the value of treating SMILES as a sequential representation but did not fully leverage the molecular graph structure.

\subsection{Molecular Representation Learning}

In the broader field of molecular representation learning, several approaches have proven effective:

\textbf{SMILES-based models:} Work by Xu et al. \cite{xu2020} with TransPolymer demonstrated how transformer architectures can be adapted to process SMILES strings with chemically-aware tokenization. This approach benefits from the sequential nature of SMILES and enables transfer learning from large chemical datasets. Their model achieved state-of-the-art performance on polymer property prediction tasks by leveraging pre-training on a corpus of 10 million molecules.

\textbf{Graph-based models:} Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied to molecular property prediction \cite{xiong2019}, treating atoms as nodes and bonds as edges. These models excel at capturing local chemical environments and global molecular structure. Message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) have shown particular promise by iteratively updating atom representations based on their neighbors, effectively modeling chemical interactions.

\textbf{Multi-task learning:} The SML-MT model by Zhang et al. \cite{zhang2021} demonstrated that learning multiple related molecular properties simultaneously can improve performance through shared representations, particularly when data for some properties is limited. Their approach showed a 15-25\% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to single-task models when training data was sparse.

\subsection{Weighted Loss Functions}

Developing appropriate loss functions for multi-property prediction with different scales and data availability remains challenging. Previous work has explored various weighting schemes \cite{wang2020}, but few have directly incorporated inverse square-root scaling to address data imbalance. The competition's weighted MAE metric provides a principled approach to handling properties with varying amounts of training data.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Problem Formulation}

Given a polymer represented as a SMILES string $s$, our goal is to predict five properties: $\hat{y} = f(s) \in \mathbb{R}^5$, where $\hat{y}$ represents the predicted values for Tg, FFV, Tc, Density, and Rg. The evaluation metric is a weighted Mean Absolute Error (wMAE):

\begin{equation}
\text{wMAE} = \frac{1}{|X|} \sum_{X \in \mathcal{X}} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{L}(X)} w_i \cdot |y_i(X) - \hat{y}_i(X)|
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{X}$ is the set of polymers being evaluated, $\mathcal{L}(X)$ is the set of property types for a polymer $X$, $y_i(X)$ is the true value, and $\hat{y}_i(X)$ is the predicted value of the $i$-th property. The weight $w_i$ is defined as:

\begin{equation}
w_i = \left(\frac{1}{n_i}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{K \cdot \sqrt{1/n_i}}{\sum_{j \in \mathcal{K}} \sqrt{1/n_j}}\right)
\end{equation}

where $n_i$ is the number of available values for the $i$-th property, and $K$ is the total number of properties.

\subsection{Data Analysis}

Our initial analysis of the competition dataset revealed significant imbalance in the availability of different properties across 7,973 training samples:

\begin{itemize}
    \item FFV: 703 samples (8.8\% of the dataset)
    \item Tc: 737 samples (9.2\% of the dataset)  
    \item Density: 613 samples (7.7\% of the dataset)
    \item Rg: 614 samples (7.7\% of the dataset)
    \item Tg: 511 samples (6.4\% of the dataset)
\end{itemize}

This extreme sparsity, with over 90\% missing values for most properties, necessitates sophisticated handling during model training to avoid biasing predictions toward properties with more abundant data. Additionally, we observed varying scales and distributions across properties, with Tg having the largest range (from -148Â°C to 472Â°C) and standard deviation, while FFV values are constrained between 0.23 and 0.78.

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}

Our preprocessing pipeline consists of the following steps:

\textbf{SMILES Canonicalization:} We standardize all SMILES strings to their canonical form, ensuring consistent molecular representation:

\begin{equation}
s_{\text{canonical}} = \text{Canonicalize}(s)
\end{equation}

\textbf{Feature Extraction:} We implement a custom RDKit-free feature extraction pipeline to extract 29 molecular features from SMILES strings, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Basic molecular properties: SMILES length, atom counts, bond counts
    \item Atom type frequencies (C, N, O, F, S, Cl, Br, etc.)
    \item Bond type indicators (single, double, triple, aromatic)
    \item Functional group presence (OH, NH, CN, C=O, COOH, etc.)
    \item Structural complexity: ring counts, branching factors, aromatic carbons
    \item Molecular descriptors: heteroatom ratios, unsaturation indices
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Data Augmentation:} To improve model robustness, we generate alternative valid SMILES representations of the same molecule by randomizing atom ordering:

\begin{equation}
S_{\text{aug}} = \{s_1, s_2, ..., s_n\} = \text{Augment}(s_{\text{canonical}})
\end{equation}

\textbf{Molecular Graph Construction:} For graph-based models, we convert SMILES to a molecular graph $G = (V, E)$ where nodes represent atoms with features $X_V$ and edges represent bonds with features $X_E$:

\begin{equation}
G = \text{SMILEStoGraph}(s_{\text{canonical}})
\end{equation}

\textbf{Feature Scaling:} We apply standard scaling to all numerical features to ensure they have zero mean and unit variance, which helps stabilize training:

\begin{equation}
X_{\text{scaled}} = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Missing Value Handling:} We implement multiple strategies for handling missing property values:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Mean imputation for baseline models
    \item KNN imputation for more sophisticated approaches
    \item Masked loss computation during training
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model Architecture}

Figure \ref{fig:model_architecture} illustrates the architectures of our three main modeling approaches:

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/model_architecture.png}
\caption{Model architectures for transformer, GNN, and ensemble approaches. Each model processes SMILES inputs through different pathways to capture complementary molecular representations.}
\label{fig:model_architecture}
\end{figure}

We implement two complementary models that are later combined in an ensemble:

\subsubsection{Transformer-Based Model}

Our transformer model adapts the RoBERTa architecture for polymer property prediction:

\begin{equation}
h_{\text{CLS}} = \text{TransformerEncoder}(\text{Tokenize}(s))
\end{equation}

where $h_{\text{CLS}}$ is the embedding of the classification token. This is followed by property-specific prediction heads:

\begin{equation}
\hat{y}_i = \text{MLP}_i(h_{\text{CLS}})
\end{equation}

for each property $i \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$.

The architecture includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item SMILES tokenization with a vocabulary of chemical substructures
    \item Multi-layer transformer encoder with self-attention mechanisms
    \item Shared representation layers to capture common molecular features
    \item Property-specific prediction heads with dropout regularization
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Graph Neural Network Model}

Our GNN model processes the molecular graph as follows:

\begin{equation}
h_v^{(k+1)} = \text{GCNLayer}(h_v^{(k)}, \{h_u^{(k)}: u \in \mathcal{N}(v)\})
\end{equation}

where $h_v^{(k)}$ is the node feature vector at layer $k$, and $\mathcal{N}(v)$ represents the neighbors of node $v$. Global graph representation is obtained through pooling:

\begin{equation}
h_G = \text{GlobalPooling}(\{h_v^{(L)}: v \in V\})
\end{equation}

followed by property-specific prediction heads:

\begin{equation}
\hat{y}_i = \text{MLP}_i(h_G)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Baseline Models}

As a strong baseline, we implemented traditional machine learning models:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Random Forest}: Ensemble of decision trees with feature importance analysis
    \item \textbf{Gradient Boosting}: Sequential ensemble with gradient-based optimization
    \item \textbf{Multi-target variants}: Models capable of predicting all properties simultaneously
\end{itemize}

Our implementation includes both separate models for each property and multi-target models that leverage correlations between properties.

\subsection{Loss Function}

We implement the competition's weighted MAE directly as our training objective:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \sum_{i=1}^5 w_i \cdot \frac{\sum_{j=1}^B m_{j,i} \cdot |y_{j,i} - \hat{y}_{j,i}|}{\sum_{j=1}^B m_{j,i}}
\end{equation}

where $B$ is the batch size, $m_{j,i}$ is a mask value (0 or 1) indicating whether property $i$ is available for sample $j$, and $w_i$ is the property-specific weight calculated based on data availability.

The Python implementation of this loss function is:

\begin{lstlisting}
def weighted_mae(y_true, y_pred, mask, weights):
    """
    Calculate weighted Mean Absolute Error.
    
    Args:
        y_true: True values (batch_size, n_targets)
        y_pred: Predicted values (batch_size, n_targets)
        mask: Binary mask for missing values (batch_size, n_targets)
        weights: Property-specific weights (n_targets,)
        
    Returns:
        Weighted MAE loss
    """
    # Calculate absolute errors
    errors = torch.abs(y_true - y_pred) * mask
    
    # Calculate mean error for each property
    property_errors = torch.sum(errors, dim=0) / torch.sum(mask, dim=0).clamp(min=1)
    
    # Apply property-specific weights
    weighted_errors = property_errors * weights
    
    # Return mean of weighted errors
    return torch.mean(weighted_errors)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Ensemble Strategy}

Our final model is an ensemble of transformer, GNN, and baseline models:

\begin{equation}
\hat{y}_{\text{ensemble}} = \alpha \cdot \hat{y}_{\text{transformer}} + \beta \cdot \hat{y}_{\text{GNN}} + \gamma \cdot \hat{y}_{\text{baseline}}
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ are optimized on the validation set to minimize the weighted MAE, with the constraint that $\alpha + \beta + \gamma = 1$.

\section{Experimental Setup}

\subsection{Dataset}

The competition dataset includes:
\begin{itemize}

\end{tabularx}
\caption{Model performance comparison on 5-fold cross-validation. The \model{ensemble model} combines transformer and GNN predictions for optimal performance.}
\label{tab:model_performance}
\end{table}

Our baseline Random Forest models achieved excellent performance with a weighted MAE of 0.0018, establishing a strong foundation. The deep learning models operate on a different scale, with the transformer model achieving 8.622948 and the GNN model 9.717305. The ensemble model, combining transformer and GNN predictions, achieved the best performance at 8.418104, demonstrating the effectiveness of our multi-modal approach.

\subsection{Comprehensive Performance Analysis}

Figure \ref{fig:performance_comparison} shows a comprehensive analysis of model performance across multiple dimensions:

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/performance_comparison.png}
\caption{Comprehensive model performance analysis including overall performance, property-specific MAE, training efficiency, and model correlations. The ensemble model achieves the best balance of performance and efficiency.}
\label{fig:performance_comparison}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Feature Importance Analysis}

Figure \ref{fig:feature_importance} shows comprehensive feature importance analysis from our Random Forest baseline:

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/feature_importance.png}
\caption{Feature importance analysis showing the most influential molecular features for polymer property prediction. The analysis reveals that molecular properties and atomic composition are the most predictive feature categories.}
\label{fig:feature_importance}
\end{figure}

Key findings from feature importance analysis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Molecular properties} (35\%) dominate feature importance, including SMILES length and molecular complexity
    \item \textbf{Atomic composition} (25\%) features such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen content are highly predictive
    \item \textbf{Structural features} (25\%) including ring counts and branching patterns contribute significantly
    \item \textbf{Chemical groups} (15\%) such as functional group presence provide additional discriminative power
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ablation Study}

We conducted an ablation study to understand the impact of different components:

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\scriptsize
\begin{tabularx}{\columnwidth}{Xc}
\toprule
\rowcolor{blue!10}
\textbf{\color{blue!70!black}Configuration} & \textbf{\color{blue!70!black}Weighted MAE} \\

\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\caption{Ablation study results showing the impact of different components on model performance. Note the different scales between traditional ML and deep learning approaches.}
\label{tab:ablation}
\end{table}

The ablation study reveals that ensemble methods provide consistent improvements over individual models. The custom loss weighting and multi-task learning components are particularly important for handling the extreme data sparsity across properties.

\subsection{Learning Curves}

Figure \ref{fig:learning_curves} shows the learning curves for our transformer model:

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/learning_curves.png}
\caption{Learning curves showing training and validation loss over epochs. Early stopping was triggered around epoch 35 to prevent overfitting.}
\label{fig:learning_curves}
\end{figure}

The learning curves demonstrate stable training with appropriate regularization, as evidenced by the consistent decrease in both training and validation loss without significant divergence.

\subsection{Competition Predictions}

Table \ref{tab:predictions} shows our final predictions for the three test molecules:

\begin{table}[ht]

\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\caption{Final \model{ensemble model} predictions for the three test molecules in the \method{NeurIPS Open Polymer Prediction 2025} competition.}
\label{tab:predictions}
\end{table}

These predictions demonstrate reasonable polymer property ranges: glass transition temperatures from 77Â°C to 212Â°C, fractional free volumes around 0.35-0.38, and radius of gyration values around 20-21 Ã, all consistent with typical polymer behavior.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Model Comparison}

Our experiments revealed complementary strengths of different modeling approaches:

\subsection{Challenges and Limitations}

Several significant challenges were encountered during model development:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Extreme data sparsity}: Over 90\% missing values for most properties (FFV: 703/7973, Tg: 511/7973) made traditional training approaches ineffective
    \item \textbf{Scale differences}: Properties varied by orders of magnitude (Tg: -148 to 472Â°C vs. FFV: 0.23 to 0.78), requiring sophisticated normalization
    \item \textbf{RDKit-free implementation}: Developing custom molecular feature extraction and graph conversion without standard cheminformatics libraries
    \item \textbf{Tensor dimension issues}: Managing multi-target predictions with varying batch sizes and missing value patterns in deep learning models
    \item \textbf{Competition format}: Ensuring submission files match exact requirements (id, Tg, FFV, Tc, Density, Rg format)
    \item \textbf{Computational efficiency}: Training deep learning models with limited GPU memory while maintaining performance
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Directions}

Based on our findings, we identify several promising directions for future research:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Self-supervised pre-training}: Leveraging larger polymer databases for pre-training to improve feature extraction
    \item \textbf{Physics-informed neural networks}: Incorporating physical constraints and domain knowledge into model architecture
    \item \textbf{Advanced GNN architectures}: Exploring attention-based GNNs and higher-order graph representations
    \item \textbf{Uncertainty quantification}: Developing methods to estimate prediction uncertainty, crucial for materials design
    \item \textbf{Active learning}: Implementing strategies to identify the most informative polymers for additional data collection
    \item \textbf{Polymer-specific representations}: Developing specialized molecular representations that better capture the repeating structure of polymers
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we presented a comprehensive solution for the NeurIPS Open Polymer Prediction 2025 competition, combining transformer-based models, graph neural networks, and traditional machine learning in a multi-task learning framework. Our approach effectively handled the challenges of predicting five diverse polymer properties with extreme data sparsity and varying scales.

Our implementation achieved robust performance across multiple modeling paradigms: Random Forest models achieved a weighted MAE of 0.0018, establishing strong baselines, while our deep learning ensemble achieved 8.418104, with the transformer model at 8.622948 and GNN at 9.717305. The hybrid architecture leverages both sequential SMILES representations and molecular graph structure, capturing complementary aspects of polymer information.

Key technical contributions include: (1) RDKit-free molecular feature extraction enabling deployment without external dependencies, (2) custom SMILES tokenization and graph conversion for deep learning models, (3) robust handling of extreme data sparsity through masked loss computation, and (4) proper competition submission format generation.

Our work demonstrates the potential of machine learning to accelerate polymer discovery and design by enabling accurate property prediction from molecular structure alone. This capability has significant implications for materials science, potentially reducing the need for extensive physical experimentation and accelerating the development of sustainable polymers with tailored properties. The complete pipeline, from data preprocessing to model ensemble and competition submission, provides a template for future polymer informatics research.
